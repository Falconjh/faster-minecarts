## Faster Minecarts

This mod attempts to balance the speed of vanilla minecarts compared to the other means of transportation available.

If you are like me and like the thought of building long railways connecting your world together, but feel that you are hampering yourself because the fastest horse can reach almost double the speed a vanilla minecart can while requiring close to no resources at the same time, then hopefully this mod can remedy that.

This mod increases the speed of all vanilla minecarts from 8m/s to 30m/s. Additionally, minecarts will be slowed down automatically around corners so as to prevent them from derailing at those speeds.

This mod requires the **Fabric mod loader**.
